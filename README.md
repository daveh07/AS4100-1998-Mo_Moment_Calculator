# Introduction
I am a Structural Engineer from Sydney Australia, i've created a main.py python script to calculate the Alpha_s & Alpha_m values as well as the buckling moment for 
steel members in bending. 

## Setup
The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

> $ git clone https://github.com/daveh07/AS4100-1998-Mo_Moment_Calculator.git

> Py Version: Python 3.9

Create a virtual environment and run main.py

## NOTE:
Please feel free to add any contributions! This is a basic calculation for most common cases of Alpha_S. Further code clauses to be added for alpha_m.  


## What I Learned
<li>Creating a command line script</li>
<li>Using Repl.it to deploy CLI App</li>
<li>Creating user inputs and performing calculations based on input values</li>
